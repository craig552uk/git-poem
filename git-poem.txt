To reuse a commit buried deep elsewhere,
(cherry-pick) can lift it out and apply it over here.

(git-stash) will keep uncommitted changes out the way,
when you're ready, you can bring them back into play.

A detached head (with Git) is no cause for concern.
It's just a commit without a branch (or so I have learned).


Now if you want to share your work you might just push and pray
but to fetch and rebase is much cleaner, safer, way.

Fetch brings the commits from a remote repository,
you should aim to organise your work with a neat history.

Personally, I like to rebase first
this replays my commits on top of previous work.

Then to make reading the history much easier and faster,
I merge, with --no-ff, this branch into master.


I have much more to learn before I become a Git Master,
But I'm confident I have the knowledge to avert repo disaster.

If you struggle with Git, if you're sometime unsure what to do,
I hope these silly rhymes help you on your journey to Git Fu.
